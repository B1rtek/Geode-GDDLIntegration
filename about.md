# <cr> GDDL Integration </c>

Displays <cr>**GDDL tiers**</c> next to demon ratings as well as the reported <cb>enjoyment</c> ratings.  
Click on the rating button (the red square) to see information about enjoyment and the amount of ratings.

![Example (that'll show up once you download it)](b1rtek.gddlintegration/tier.png)

If the rating doesn't load, <cb>refresh</c> the level page (It happens sometimes if you have the level saved already)

Adds a button on your profile that shows how many demons of each tier you've beaten

## Known issues

- <cy>Usernames</c> sometimes turn into <cy>`-`</c> after a <cr>failed</c> request, this is just cosmetic though (
  [apparently Rob's fault](https://github.com/geode-sdk/indexer/issues/557#issuecomment-1913375319))
- Opening the *GDDL Demon Split* popup <co>might</c> cause a lag, don't worry about that :)

If you encounter any other issues, contact me on Discord (<cb>@b1rtek</c>) or on Github
