# <cr> GDDL Integration </c>

## Features
- Displays <cr>GDDL ratings</c> of demon levels, click on the <cb>button</c> to see more info about the level
- Includes a <cy>superior to Rob's</c> demon searching UI - allowing to search by a part of the level name, GDDL tiers <co>and more!</c>
- If you want to just search for levels from a tier, there's a <cp>simpler UI</c> hidden behind an <cg>arrow button</c> in the bottom right corner
- Adds a <cr>GDDL Tier Split</c> page showing how many levels of which tier you've completed, click on the tier labels to see the completed levels

**<cy>Positions of UI elements can be adjusted in the settings, be sure to visit them if one of your other mods overlaps UI elements with this one</c>**

## Known issues
If you encounter an <cy>issue</c> with the mod, [open an issue in the mod's GitHub repo](https://github.com/B1rtek/Geode-GDDLIntegration/issues/new/choose) or contact me on Discord (<cb>@b1rtek</c>)
- <cy>Usernames</c> sometimes turn into <cy>`-`</c> after a <cr>failed</c> request, this is just cosmetic though ([apparently Rob's fault](https://github.com/geode-sdk/indexer/issues/557#issuecomment-1913375319))
- Opening the *GDDL Demon Split* popup <co>might</c> cause a lag, don't worry about that :)
- The level browser <co>might</c> display a button which should allow you to go to the next page of results even though there might be no more pages
